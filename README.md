you’ll need the Expo app for your phone to run your project on. Search for the Expo app in the relevant app store for your device (iOS or Android).

● Head over to the Expo signup page and follow the instructions to create an account.

● Now, you should be able to log in to Expo from your browser and mobile app.

    apiKey: "your_apiKey",
    authDomain: "yout_authDomain",
    projectId: "yout_ProjectId",
    storageBucket: "your_storageBucket",
    messagingSenderId: "your_messagingSenderId",
    appId: "your_appId",
    measurementId: "Your_measurementId"
  };
  // Initialize Firebase
  firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
  firebase.analytics();
</script>
inside Chat.js add your credential inside the constructor
export default class Chat extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      messages: [],
      user: {
        _id: 1,
        name: "Manpreet",
        avatar: "https://placeimg.com/140/140/any",
      },
      uid: 0,
      loggedInText: "Please wait, you are getting logged in",
      isConnected: false,
      image: null,
    };
    if (!firebase.apps.length) {
      // firebase credentials
      firebase.initializeApp({
        apiKey: "AIzaSyDSgFiVJ2933nxF9SBotfer6C_wsvC68uo",
        authDomain: "lets-chat-1657c.firebaseapp.com",
